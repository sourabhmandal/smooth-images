# How to start the server

I have added a docker compose file with all the dependencies of app

Due to issues with sharp library I am not able to build and run the app with docker-compose. Hence we have two step process of running the app

1. Install Dev dependencies - `npm install`
2. Run the Docker compose file - `docker compose up -d`
3. Run the node.js app - `npm run dev`
